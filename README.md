If you want to contribute to this project you need to use the same structure and guidelines followed by this project.

This project is made in CLion, as an CMake project Using the PlatformIO Plugin for building and flashing of the microcontroller. There are alternative methods
but they are not covered here.

You need to install [Platform IO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html), and add the
Install Shell Commands as instructed [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#piocore-install-shell-commands), [here](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)
are some supplementary help for Windows 10. The plugin for CLion is also required,
for building and flashing of the program. The plugin can be found in the plugin marketplace in CLion (Settings/Preferences | Plugins).

After cloning the project to CLion you need to Re-Init (Tools->PlatformIO->Re-Init) the project to build and flash the program.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
